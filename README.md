# üå± Green Buddy - Your Home Gardening Buddy üë®‚Äçüåæ‚úÇÔ∏èüå≥üçÄ
Group project - Group-1

## üì¢ About The Project
+ Green Buddy is a user-friendly website designed to help both registered and guest users perform gardening activities efficiently and effectively. With this app, users can create their own account to access information like detailed plant information, plant care tips, weather forecast details, nearby gardening shops, recommended videos based on plant to help plan their gardening activities effectively.
+ Green Buddy was created with an aim to address the challenges that many gardeners face for not having proper information, such as choosing the right plants, understanding the care requirements, and managing their gardens effectively.
+ The website provides personalized recommendations, brief suggestions based on temperature, care guides, and an interactive platform where users can add plant collections to their profile, including species information and other relevant details to keep track of their plants.


## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

While gardening is an interesting hobby, sometimes it can be frustrating if things are not working out as expected and this may highly be due to lack of proper information. Some of the challenges faced by new gardeners are:

1. Lack of proper plant information: Many gardeners don't have proper information about the plants. Lack of proper information about the plant results in poor planting strategies and outcomes.

2. Inadequate Plant Care: Due to lack of information and knowledge about plant care, gardeners, especially new gardeners, often struggle to take proper care for their plants. Care for plants often requires proper knowledge on areas like pruning, watering, and sunlight requirements. This results in unhealthy plants and a bad gardening experience.

3. Adaptation to weather: Gardeners often struggle to adapt their care schedule according to the rapidly changing weather conditions. Without proper information of weather conditions, gardeners face poor planting experience which also damages their plants and affect their confidence.

4. Limited Access to Quality Garden Shops: For gardeners, it is important to get good quality gardening supplies and advice when choosing local shops that satisfy their expectations. Finding a quality shop with good rating along with other important details is challenging for gardeners. Not all garden shops offer a range of products or have knowledgeable staff, making it difficult for gardeners to find what they need.

5. User preference for visual information: Having loads of text-based data on plant care might confuse gardeners at times. Some prefer to visualise information through videos. Lack of proper information on good videos to follow may result in following bad suggestions.

## üöÄModules / Packages / Libraries Used

- **Requests:** This module allows sending HTTP requests from python

   `pip install requests`


    from requests import RequestException
    import json


- **Collections:** It is a built-in module (No installation is required). The collections module in python provides different types of containers. A Container is an object that is used to store different objects and provide a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them. 

  In this project we have used Counter().

   **Counter() -** A counter is a subclass of the dictionary. It is used to keep the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered dictionary where the key represents the element in the iterable and value represents the count of that element in the iterable.
    
   `from collections import Counter`

- **Flask:** A WSGI web application framework for Python.  It is used to build websites using python. We chose this because of its efficient and beginner-friendly ability to create good-looking websites, easy integration with Databases and smooth handling of requests from users.

   `pip install flask`


  **NOTE** - Installing flask automatically installs some other dependencies we have used in the project (jinja2 and werkzeug)
  

         from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request, flash, json, jsonify, redirect, url_for



- **Flask login:** Flask-login provides user session management for Flask. It handles the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your users' sessions over extended periods of time.
      
   `pip install flask-login`

- **Flask SQLAlchemy:** Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for integrating SQLAlchemy with Flask. It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish common tasks.

   `pip install flask-sqlalchemy`

- **Google API client (YouTube API) :** Library to easily manage API calls and other processes for Google APIs

   `pip install google-api-python-client`

- **pytest:** pytest: A testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases for Python code.
- 
   `pip install pytest`

- **responses:** Library used to mock API calls during Testing

     `pip install responses`
